## Roadmap for the Cobalt UI library

During the initial stages of development of this library, there were a lot of tasks that I wanted to complete, but didn't have time to do so! Below is a list of changes that should be made to the library in the near to short term:

-	Improving test coverage
-	Implement a dependency update mechanism, to keep the site secure and vulnerability free (where possible)
-	More documentation
-	Dependency updates
-	Finish RadioButton
-	Get SideBar working in Storybook
-	Explore any components not with 3 or more variants, and add if possible
-	Augment CSS Grid properties for ImageGrid
-	Realign components into named group for npm – not under my name, but cobaltui
-	Storybook updates
-	Conversion to Typescript?
-	Expand tests
-	Add snapshot update option
-	Make sure all components have same cobalt-xxxxx container for class
-	Make the image service more dynamic – size and source/category
-	Check out some of the other CSS Grid properties – what could we use?
-	Image service – what about putting a spinner/waiting for image change in


# Future Candidates:
Below are a list of components I would like to see created for the library, in no particular order:

-	Avatar
-	Cards – such as for product information
-	Progressbar
-	Switch
-	Tags
-	HTML5 form field elements, such as email or telephone
-	Popover
-	ListBox
